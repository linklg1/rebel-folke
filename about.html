           Jasper grew up in Saskatchewan but has been living in Vancouver for a bit now. 
           Jasper’s painting is acrylic paint with permanent markers. Jasper was inspired by a street they walk by often where a 
           Palestinian flag is proudly waving right next to the busy traffic for everyone to see.</p>

             Link is a queer-trans Palestinian-Jordanian settler in “Vancouver”. 
            They have taken time away from poetry but this piece has been a long standing favourite they’ve written. 
            The inspiration for the poem came from dreams and childhood memories as well as Links life long struggle with depression and anxiety. 
            Link is involved in the Free Palestine movement through the obligation that calls us all to work to create a just world. 
            You can see them biking around the city with flags raised, keffiyeh on and music blasting. 
            They hope this poem will bring comfort to those who share similar struggles.
