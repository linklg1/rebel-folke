           Jasper grew up in Saskatchewan but has been living in Vancouver for a bit now. 
           Jasper’s painting is acrylic paint with permanent markers. Jasper was inspired by a street they walk by often where a 
           Palestinian flag is proudly waving right next to the busy traffic for everyone to see.</p>

            I am on a school bus She catches my eyes I look away She does it again Her name is Paradise I am trying slowly To understand How the clock turns But only has two hands To show for it
           I am Trying Slowly To understand How do I begin again When I am Underneath Myself How I am trying slowly To ride this school bus My radio is broken And I only have two hands
           To show for it The storm rages on Around me Her name is Paradise And she's caught my eye Again I look away The tides turn The city crumbles And I Am beneath Myself
           I will miss you Old radio You make a far better watch Anyhow I'll be over here Waiting Slowly To figure out How I can climb this mountain The bus driver Asks me for directions
           I am 4 years old I know the way home By the shapes of the rocks And the curves in the trees I am scared but I walk On the moving bus Ten times my size Our field trip
           Ends on my family farm The king of my country Has been watching over us When he died The school yard Filled with tears My mentor walks me Up the mountain
           She tells me There is a paradise And I understand For she has Caught my eyes and alas I am awake The lightening flashes I tell my mother I am afraid of the man Who flips the switch
           She laughs at me. On the school bus My radio is dead I am beneath myself Paradise looks at me With purple eyes I am awake I am trying And I am ashamed I only Have two hands

             Link is a queer-trans Palestinian-Jordanian settler in “Vancouver”. 
            They have taken time away from poetry but this piece has been a long standing favourite they’ve written. 
            The inspiration for the poem came from dreams and childhood memories as well as Links life long struggle with depression and anxiety. 
            Link is involved in the Free Palestine movement through the obligation that calls us all to work to create a just world. 
            You can see them biking around the city with flags raised, keffiyeh on and music blasting. 
            They hope this poem will bring comfort to those who share similar struggles.
